Apologies for the confusion. If you want to display the JSON data in a more readable format on the webpage itself, you can use the `JSON.stringify()` function with some HTML formatting. Here's the updated code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Display JSON Data</title>
</head>
<body>

<pre id="json-display"></pre>

<script>
// Your JSON data
var jsonData = {
  "section": {
    "class": "game-section",
    "h2": {
      "class": "line-title",
      "text": "trending games"
    },
    "div": {

          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
};

// Function to display JSON data
function displayJSON(data, elementId) {
  var element = document.getElementById(elementId);
  element.innerHTML = JSON.stringify(data, null, 2);
}

// Call the function to display JSON data
displayJSON(jsonData, 'json-display');
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This code will display the JSON data within a `<pre>` tag, which preserves the formatting and displays the JSON in a more readable manner.
